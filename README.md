# Lesley-portfolio
 I have created My digital portfolio on which i will showcase my projects and skills.
 In creation of this portfolio i have used the following technologies:
  - HTML
  - CSS 
  - JavaScript
    
After creating the portfolio:
- I have pushed my HTML,CSS and JavaScript files to a GitHub repo for them to be ready for deployment.
- In Azure Portal:
    1. I created subscription named "MyAzurePortfolioSub"
    2. Inside MyAzurePortfolioSub I created resource group named "MyAzurePortfolioRG"
    3. Inside MyAzurePortfolioRG I created Static Web App resource,then i went to Deployment Center.
- Link my GitHub repo and branch.

From this project i have developed the following skills

- Basic deployment practices.
